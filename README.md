## Dynamont

TODO: change title
A **dynam**ic programming algorithm to resquiggle and segment the raw **ONT** signal.

TODO: add readme
TODO: create conda package of tool
TODO: build tool with subtools

## Installation

### Pypi/pip

```bash
pip install dynamont
```

### Conda

```bash
conda install mamba
mamba create -n dynamont -c jannessp dynamont
conda activate dynamont
```

## Usage

TODO

## Exit-Codes

- -11: Segmentation fault
- -9: Out of Memory error. Decrease the number of processes or move to a system with more memory.
- -6: std::bad_alloc
- 1: `dynamont-NTK` specific: alignment score (Z) does not match between forward and backward run in preprocessing on signal (T) and read (N) in function: `preProcTN`
- 2: `dynamont-NTK` specific: alignment score (Z) does not match between forward and backward run in preprocessing on signal (T) and de novo calling (K) in function: `preProcTK`
- 3: Alignment score (Z) does not match between forward and backward run in `main` function or is -Infinity
- 4: Input signal is missing or not found in stdin stream
- 5: Input read is missing or not found in stdin stream
- 6: Model file contains a k-mer that does not match the k-mer size of the pore
- 7: Invalid model path was provided
- 8: Provided ONT signal too short
- 9: Provided reads too short
- 10: Signal is smaller than read
- 11: Read is smaller than `kmerSize` of pore type
