A **Dynam**ic Programming Approach to Segment **ONT** Signals. 
Dynamont is a segmentation/resquiggling tool for ONT signals.
**Dynamont is currently designed for RNA002 and RNA004 data!**
- Currently, I applied the trained transition parameters from the RNA004 model to the DNA R10 models. These should be fine-tuned for the DNA models.

# Installation

## Pypi/pip

```bash
pip install dynamont
```

## Conda

```bash
conda config --add channels jannessp # to install all dependencies from the correct channel
conda create -n dynamont jannessp::dynamont
conda activate dynamont
```

# Usage

```bash
# segment a dataset
dynamont-resquiggle -r <path/to/pod5/dataset/> -b <basecalls.bam> --mode basic --model_path <path/to/model> -o <output.csv> -p <pore>

# train model
dynamont-train -r <path/to/pod5/dataset/> -b <basecalls.bam> --mode basic --model_path <path/to/init/model> -o <output/path> -p <pore>
```

# Output

Dynamont produces a tabular output with the following columns:  

| Column Name             | Description |
|-------------------------|-------------|
| **readid**             | Unique identifier for the read. |
| **signalid**           | Identifier for the signal corresponding to the read. |
| **start**              | Start position of the signal segment in the read. |
| **end**                | End position of the signal segment in the read. |
| **basepos**            | Reference base position in the genomic sequence. |
| **base**               | The detected base at this position. |
| **motif**              | The surrounding sequence motif in which the base appears. |
| **state**              | The methylation state (or modification state) of the base. |
| **posterior_probability** | Probability assigned to the predicted segment. |
| **polish**             | Polished kmer, only available in resquiggle mode. |

# Exit-Codes

- -11: Segmentation fault
- -9: Out of Memory error. Decrease the number of processes or move to a system with more memory.
- -6: std::bad_alloc
- 1: `resquiggle mode` specific: alignment score (Z) does not match between forward and backward run in preprocessing on signal (T) and read (N).
- 2: `resquiggle mode` specific: alignment score (Z) does not match between forward and backward run in preprocessing on signal (T) and error correction (C).
- 3: Alignment score (Z) does not match between forward and backward pass or is -Infinity
- 4: Input signal is missing or not found in stdin stream
- 5: Input read is missing or not found in stdin stream
- 7: Invalid model path was provided
- 8: Provided ONT signal is too short
- 9: Read is too short
- 10: Signal is smaller than read
- 11: Read is smaller than `kmerSize` of provided pore model
